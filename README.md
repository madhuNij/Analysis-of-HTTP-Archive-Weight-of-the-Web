 The weight of a webpage is a factor of all its components like the HTML page, embedded images, hyperlinks and third-party resources. With an increase in the use of CSS, JavaScript and other technologies, there is a noticeable growth in the weight of the web. These components have a computation cost and reflect in computational resources to transmit, process and render in a web browser. This gives rise to the need of studying the weight of the webpage in detail. In this project we use the HTTP Archive database which logs historical data of multiple websites and focus on top technologies that have contributed to the weight of the web from the year 2016 to 2022. We look at mainly Advertising Networks, JavaScript Frameworks, Content Management Systems (CMS), Web Frameworks and Ecommerce related technologies and how they affect a webpage.
